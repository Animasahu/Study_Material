How code is executed in JavaScript --

1. When the JavaScript engine scans a script file , it makes an environment called the Execution Context.
2. The execution context execute code in two phases - (1) Memory creation phase (2) Code excution phase
3. In memory creation phase, JavaScript will allocate memory to all the variables and functions inside the global space.
4. Variables are stored as undefined and for functions the whole function definition is stored inside the memory space.
5. In code execution phase all the variable will be allocated the value assigned to them in the code.
6. During Code Execution if a function is invoked a new execution context is created for that function.
7. Once code is excetued the execution context will be deleted.
8. Also , JavaScript has a call stack which handles all the excution context .Whenever a new execution context is created it is pushed to the call stack.
9. call stack ,anages the order of execution of all execution contexts.
