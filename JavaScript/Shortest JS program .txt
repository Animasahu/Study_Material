Shortest JS program -- 

1. Shortest Program in js : "Empty file".
2. JavaScript Engine creates a global object whenever we run a js code . In case of browers,  this global object known as "window" .
3. 'window' is actually global object which is created along with the global execution context.
4. Whenever any js program run a global object is created , a global execution context is created and along with the execution context 'this' variable is created. 
   Even through our file is empty the also its created.
5. At the global lavel 'this' point to the global object.
6. Any thing that is not inside any funtion is the "global space".
7. Whenever we create any variable or functions in the "global space" , they got attached to the global object. 
   So access the variable/function defined in the global space, we can use any of the below,
   
   var a = 10; -> global space
   function b(){ -> global space
    var x = 10;  -> not in global space
   }
   console.log(window.a);
   console.log(a);
   console.log(x); -> error undefined
   console.log(this.a); // at the global lavel , where 'this' point to the window object.
